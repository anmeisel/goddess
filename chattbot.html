  "One thing that’s remarkable about linguistic change is how large-scale changes in the structure of a language can sometimes be attributed to generalization from a single exception. A nice example of this is found in the history of the gender system of the Northeast Caucasian language Lak. Lak has four genders, which are conventionally labelled by Roman numerals I-IV. Roughly, class I is for male humans, class II is for female humans, class III is for non-human animates and class IV is for liquids and abstract nouns; concrete inanimates are spread irregularly over classes III and IV, although the majority are in class III, and some non-human animates and liquids are found unexpectedly in classes III or IV.<br>However, in the modern language, nouns referring to female humans are often found in class III rather than class II. Already in the earliest description of the language, Uslar (1890), it is recorded that nouns referring to young women behaved as class III nouns. A woman would only start being referred to and referring to herself using class II nouns at some time between marriage and the birth of her first child; if she did this too early, or kept doing it too late, it would be seen as a ridiculous affectation of an inappropriate age status, and if others did it too early or too late it was considered an insult. (The distinction between classes II and III is thus comparable to the distinction between the Mrs and Miss titles in English, although the line is drawn slightly differently.) The use of class II has become more and more restricted since then; Khaidakov (1963) found that it tended to be restricted to immediate family members of an older generation, and it would be impolite to address even an old woman using a class II term if she was not a relative. In one dialect, that of Arakul’, it has gone so far that class II has been eliminated entirely.<br>Why did class III—a class originally reserved for non-humans—expand so as to include most women?<br>When we put it like that, it seems odd that women would be offended by not being included in class III rather than the other way around. The probable explanation is that it is a generalization of a single exception which already existed in the language involving the word duš ‘girl’. This word might have always been in class III, rather than class II. Cf. German Mädchen ‘girl’, which is famously neuter rather than feminine; in the case of this word it’s because it’s a dimunitive, and a morphological rule that dimunitives are neuter takes precedence over the semantic rule that female humans are feminine. I don’t know if there is a similar morphological explanation in the case of duš, but there’s also a semantic reason why words for ‘girl’ are not prototypical feminine gender words: children tend to be seen as having a neutral gender. And if the idea that ‘girl’ would be assigned feminine gender still seems implausible, consider the fact that the sense of ‘girl’ can be a specialization of an older sense of ‘child’, in general. In fact, the English word girl was originally gender-neutral. And we know that the whole development has taken place in the Indo-Aryan language Konkani. Konkani has the traditional three Indo-European genders: masculine, feminine and neuter. The word čeḍũ is neuter, and originally meant ‘child’, but came to mean specifically ‘girl’ in recent times, and the neuter gender has been extended to other words such as bayl ‘woman’ when they refer to young women, as opposed to old women. The feminine gender has not been eliminated yet in Konkani, although it’s conceivable that it might be, eventually. So the change which has been happening in Lak is not just a one-off oddity, but something which seems to be encouraged by a combination of morphological, semantic and sociolinguistic circumstances which tend to co-occur across different cultures and languages.<br>All this is from Corbett’s Gender (1991) (which I was having a look through again recently).",

  "<strong>thetapunk asked:</strong><br>Can we not us the the term “biologically female”?<br>My apologies!<br>I wish there was a better way to say “these organs that do the baby carrying thing” without saying “biologically female.” Because in the science world there’s ‘male’ and ‘female’ reproductive organs, and while that’s all well and good to identify a person’s organs, it’s also used for binary genders.<br>Scientists use “female” for those in that species who have the eggs. “Male” is those who give the sperm. There’s not much for terms outside those two. So how does one separate the word “female” from female-designated genitals (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, all that shabam) and “male” from male-designated genitals (testes, penis, scrotum, that jazz)? IS there a different term from “male” and “female” I can use to refer to the BIOLOGICAL organs, not the gender?<br>For now I don’t know any. Otherwise I’d use those words, not ‘male’ and ‘female’ since those are genders.<br>So, to say “biologically female” I really mean “those organs that do that thing” and not to CALL them “female.”<br>(I’m terrible at explaining my struggle.)",

  "(GIF series of Caroline Heldman at TEDxYouth@SanDiego “The Sexy Lie”:)<br>So, self-objectification, 10 years of research, mostly done by psychologists, we know that it has some pretty severe affects.<br>The more we think of ourselves and internalize this idea of being sex objects the higher our rates of depression.<br>We also engage in habitual body monitoring when we view ourselves as sex objects. What is habitual body monitoring? For the men in the audience, this might be news to you. It is not news to the women in the audience.<br>We think about the positioning of our legs, the position of our hair, where the light if falling, who’s looking at us, who’s not looking at us. In fact, in the 5 minutes that I’ve been giving this talk, on average the women in this audience have engaged in habitual body monitoring 10 times. That is every 30 seconds.<br>Eating disorders are much more prevalent with those who view themselves as sex objects, as well as body shame and depressed cognitive functioning. If we’re engaging in habitual body monitoring it simply takes up more mental space that can be better used completing math tests, completing your homework. It just sucks our cognitive functioning.<br>Also, sexual dysfunction. So, this idea that ‘sex sells’, isn’t it strange that if you think of yourself as a sex object and we’re raised in a society that raises little girls to view their bodies as projects to work on and be sex objects, that it actually gets in the way of good sex?<br>So, what tends to happen is the women who are high self-objectifiers actually engage in what’s called, ‘spectatoring’ during sex acts. So instead of being involved and engaged in the pleasure of what’s happening, you tend to view yourself from a third party perspective, a spectator’s perspective. Where you’re worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like… so again, it gets in the way of sexual pleasure.<br>[Self-objectification] lowers your ability to get along with other women. We engage in female competition. We see male attention as the holy grail of our existence by-and-large and so we compete with other women for our own self-esteem because we see it as this finite resource. This cherished finite resource. So we go into parties and we know where we are in the pretty girl pecking order and when another woman is valued for being a sex object, it actually makes us feel bad about ourselves.",

  "Oxford English Dictionary Adds 15 new Transgender and Nonbinary Terms to its Online Dictionary! <br> Oxford Dictionary has just added a slew of important trans and nonbinary terminology to its online dictionary, OxfordDictionaries.com. The following terms are now officially defined in US English: <br> Agender, Bi-gender, Cisgender, Cissexism, FTM, Gender Dysphoria, Gender Identity, Gender-fluid, Genderqueer, Misgender, MTF, Mx, Nonbinary, Transman, Transperson, Transphobia, and Transwoman! <br> Life Outside The Binary does not necessarily endorse the particular definitions nor the wording therein. Many of these definitions may be overly simplistic or use outdated terminology. It is certainly more important to understand each individual’s understanding and relationship to a given term, and to understand their history and social context, rather than to differ to a broad general definition. There are also many other important words (such as transmisogyny, binarism and other identities such as neutrois and androgyne) that definitely deserve inclusion in dictionaries. <br> However, this is still a huge win for transgender and non-binary people! Especially words such as “cissexism,” “transphobia,” and “misgender,” (as well as several common transgender identities) being defined in a reputable online language resource may represent a huge step toward developing common understanding and acceptance of trans and nonbinary people and issues. <br> -Lane <br> now people can stop saying “those aren’t real words”",

Not only must full equality therefore be possible, our worldview must become androgynous.<br><strong>Fat feminism:</strong> There must be acceptance of women of all sizes. It is important to recognize how misogyny and sexism intersect with sizism and anti-fat bias.<br><strong>Islamic feminism:</strong> The patriarchal interpretation of the Qu'ran must be questioned. The deeply rooted teachings of equality in islam must be highlighted so that full equality for all muslims regardless of gender can be achieved.<br><strong>Jewish feminism:</strong> Jewish women should have equal legal, societal and religious status as Jewish men.<br><strong>Lesbian feminism:</strong> The assumption that everyone is straight must be renounced and society should not be structured around it. Lesbian women should have a voice in the discourse around gender equality.<br><strong>Liberal feminism:</strong> Women are personally and individually responsible for achieving their own equality in our society. Customary and legal restraints that block women's equal access into society must be removed.<br><strong>Lipstick feminism:</strong> Traditionally feminine objects and attributes should be reclaimed and actively embraced. This includes the sexual power of women.<br>Material feminism: Capitalism and the patriarchy are the primary means of maintaining inequality of the sexes, races and economic classes.<br><strong>New feminism:</strong> Women and men have inherently different strenghts and weaknesses, which serve to compliment each other.<br><strong>Postcolonial feminism:</strong> Women in non-Western countries are misrepresented by the mainstream 'global' feminist movement. A closer look should be cast upon the lasting effects of racism and colonialism in the current positions of these women.<br><strong>Post-structural feminism:</strong> In battling inequality, it is important to recognize that there are no universal, singular categories that define 'men' and 'women'.<br><strong>Radical feminism:</strong> Male supremacy is the main cause of women's oppression. Women should oppose standard gender roles and eventually society should be radically reordered. [Warning: transphobic beliefs coming up. OP of this post strongly opposes this belief.] Transgender women retain male privilege and reinforce restrictive and damaging gender norms in their presentation.<br><strong>Seperatist feminism:</strong> Women and girls should be the main focus of the feminist movement.

  "“Female-assigned intersex kids’ vaginal canal size is also assessed by doctors, to ensure that it’s long enough to fit a penis inside of it. Doctors might surgically construct or re-construct vaginas, which can result in a host of health problems and necessitate multiple, multiple surgeries. This is especially the case since most intersex kids have these surgeries very young, and when their bodies grow into their adult forms, more surgeries are necessary to keep their vagina size in proportion. Non-surgical methods are also used to increase or maintain vaginal length by regularly using medical dildos to stretch the vagina over months and years. (It’s kind of like braces for your vagina, but much, much worse.) Just like there are no standards for how long a clitoris “can” be before it’s classified as a penis, there aren’t absolute standards as to how long a vagina is for it to be of “normal” length.<br>I had a dilation procedure performed for almost every exam I had with intersex doctors from the time I was 8 until I was 16, so that they could check how long my vagina was as I grew. I absolutely hated these procedures. I mean, imagine a man as old as your father or your grandfather, who you don’t know, inserting a medical dildo into you each time you saw him, knowing that you can’t question the doctor’s orders and just accept that you have to undergo these uncomfortable procedures for your health. Imagine a decade or so later, realizing that these procedures did nothing to track your health, and had everything to do with grown men feeling good about the fact that you could fuck some dude someday like a “normal girl”. That all those traumatizing procedures weren’t actually medically relevant at all, and it actually was within my right to refuse those examinations.<br>I didn’t know any of that at the time.<br>I also had no idea that I wouldn’t want to ultimately have the kind of sex they assumed I’d be having, adding yet another layer of this-was-totally-unnecessary/messed-up to my history.<br>Other kids shouldn’t have to go through this. Other adults shouldn’t have revelations some day far into the future that what was happening to them WASN’T okay, and their traumatic feelings ARE valid, and the whole system of how intersex people are conceptualized and “treated” IS entirely fucked.<br>And it’s gotta change.

Oh and men want to fuck everything- from girls, to donuts, to their left sock, in order to- evolutionarily speaking- ‘spread their seed’, right…? We roll these ‘facts of life’ off our tongues with such confidence, treating them as ‘common sense’ because we’ve seen enough Hollywood flicks to have these biological stereotypes reiterated to us, time and time again. <strong>We nod knowingly when people fit into rigid sexual stereotypes- oh, she’s just being a girl- and pathologize anyone who deviates from the ‘norm’ as sexual outliers, instead of accepting the infinite forms that sexual wanting can take, across all genders and sexualities.</strong> Many people don’t identify with their socially assigned sexual archetype- there are asexual men and hyper-sexual women, for instance, who would rather approach themselves as authentic sexual people rather than hormonal reactions personified, or a slave to their biological predispositions.The problem with identifying all men as ’more sexual than all women’ is that it disempowers female sexual agency, contributes to the pathologization of sexual women,  and most frightening of all, paints sex as a male activity; something that men enjoy and women endure, something that men are entitled to ‘collect’ from women- his wife refuses to have sex with him, how could she do that to a man?- being somehow more needy of it than their female counterparts.<br>‘The hormone argument’ reduces the actions, desires and capabilities of men and women to a series of hormonal reactions. Social perceptions of the ‘overwhelming and inescapable grip of testosterone over decent men’s minds’ are often misused to justify rape or violence as part of some kind of natural and inevitable human process. Catcalling, rape, domestic violence, public masturbation and workplace sexual harassment are grouped together under the umbrella of male ‘primal’ behavior; understood as a biological reality as unchangeable as our DNA, as deeply rooted in our ‘animal identities’ as our ape ancestors. <strong>Female menstruation is pathologized as a hormone induced sickness of the mind; symptoms of which include irrationality, hysteria and uncontrollable or unjustifiable bursts of emotion.</strong> Notions of the ‘mental deficiencies’ of women during menstruation are often used as reasoning as to why corporate leaders, political representatives, surgeons, judges or other positions of power that require ‘rational decision making’ should all belong to men, who are immune to such ‘estrogen-related hysteria’. Women themselves reinforce this most oppressive stereotype by speaking about their emotions as unquestionably linked to their menstrual cycles- I’m sorry I got angry before, it’s just my time of month. Hormonal stereotyping also assumes that, by nature, every woman’s ultimate goal in life is to have children, and a means of stability for those children, which not only pathologizes women who don’t identify with motherhood for any number of reasons, but also paints childless women as either ’trying and failing’ -she’s 35 and childless, the poor thing must be desperate by now- or, if childlessness is perceived as an obvious lifestyle choice for her, she may invite the ‘selfish’ or ’wasteful’ label, for not fulfilling her assigned biological destiny. When a woman is lectured this way about what women’s bodies ‘are for’, she is taught that any agency she harbours comes second to her ‘function’, and that her body is not her own to make decisions for. This can be very dehumanising.<br>Acknowledging how studies have shown that certain hormones are linked to or even held accountable for certain human behaviours is recognising and appreciating science. <strong>Assuming that a person’s hormones determines or should determine their character, their physical, mental or emotional capabilities, the nature of their sexual wanting (including sexual orientation), or the shape of their preferred lifestyle, is not science; it’s discrimination.</strong><br>If the situation would have allowed me, I would have told that female customer I was serving that yes, it’s true that men and women are biologically different, but if we were really living out our ‘biological destinies’, if our hormones were really dictating our every sexual move the way we give them credit to, there would only really be two types of people in the world- two sexualities, two lifestyles, two ways of fucking. We know that’s not true- sexuality is fluid, complex and authentic, and every person experiences sex and sexual feeling differently. Our needs, desires and reactions to different stimuli are not given to us at birth in a handbook; they develop alongside our personal and cultural experiences, our tastes, our religious, intellectual or political convictions- eventually blooming into unlimited variations of sexual authenticity, many of which may diverge from what hormonal stereotyping might have us expect.",

  "Aaron Clarey isn’t really a Mad Max fan.<br>This is pretty clear already given that his viral rant about Fury Road doesn’t betray much knowledge of the franchise at all—he doesn’t seem aware that “the director of Fury Road” he reviles is, in fact, George Miller, the director of the entire Mad Max franchise. He calls one of the most iconic Australian cultural exports of all time a “piece of American culture.” He boldly states “No one barks orders to Max!” when, in fact, all three previous Mad Max films feature Max taking orders from someone (Roger Ward’s Captain Fifi in Mad Max, Michael Preston’s Papagallo in The Road Warrior, Tina Turner’s Auntie Entity in Beyond Thunderdome).<br>But the single biggest sign Clarey doesn’t know the first damn thing about what George Miller or Mad Max is his triumphalist line: “When the shit hits the fan, it will be men like Mad Max who will be in charge.”<br>Mad Max isn’t in charge of anything throughout the Mad Max film franchise. Max is emphatically not the archetype of the badass hero who gets the girl, gets the crown, and rules as a patriarch over society as is his due. He’s a fucked-up loner who isn’t fit to live among civilized people; who begins each film alone, wounded, broken, and who ends each film in the same state or worse.<br>[…]All the Mad Max films have had tragic endings, and if you don’t grasp that this is the tragedy at the heart of Mad Max (and the gritty Westerns and samurai films Mad Max emulates) then you don’t get Mad Max.
